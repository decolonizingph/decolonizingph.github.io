## Learning Outcomes

test.

## Methods of Instruction

This course is heavily based on discussions and collaborative learning. The course will be taught **synchronously** and delivered weekly **in-person**. We will also be heavily relying on discussion boards (available via bCourses) as a supplement to our readings and lectures to stimulate conversations among students. 

## Attendance

Attendance is mandatory due to the participatory nature of the course. You are allowed **2 unexcused absences**. If you miss more than 2 classes without an excuse, you will be at risk of not passing this  DeCal. In the event of a special circumstance or emergency, please email the course facilitators at [decolonizingph@gmail.com](mailto:decolonizingph@gmail.com) within three days of the missed class so that we can arrange a makeup opportunity and lend our support to you if need be. If a certain situation will affect your ability to attend lectures for the majority of the semester (i.e., illness), accommodations can be made. Again, please contact our course email for any concerns about attendance so we can work with you.



## Grading

This course is **pass/no pass**, so everything will be graded on a satisfactory completion basis. You must have a 70% or higher to pass the course. If your completion of an assignment or your participation in coursework is unsatisfactory, we will reach out to you to arrange makeup opportunities and/or to brainstorm strategies so that you may succeed in the course. The grading breakdown is shown below:

| Assignment          | Percent of Grade    |

## A Note on Mental Health

This class focuses on systemic violence and discussions on difficult and often emotional topics. Because of this, there may be content that some students find to be triggering. If you are unable to attend a class because the coursework for that day may be upsetting to you, please let the facilitators know and take care of yourself. Preserving mental health is very important to us, so please make use of the following resources if need be, and talk to us if we can support you in any way.
