    "content": "This course seeks to reframe public health narratives about “developing” nations and disadvantaged communities by looking at the roots of that disadvantage, and by examining health from the perspective of the colonized. It explores how colonial ideals perpetuate structural violence on bodies and cultures and it challenges paradigmatic thinking about biomedicine and public health. It will analyze current issues in public health–such as healthcare disparities due to sexuality, gender, and race– in an effort to demonstrate how public health and western/colonial ideologies intersect and enact violence. The ultimate goal of this course is to decolonize the field; by looking at public health as both creating and being created by structures of power, this course aims to recapture current conversations surrounding global health and make the field better-serving for all.

    "content": "Decolonizing Bodies in Public Health recognizes that Berkeley sits on the territory of xučyun (Huichin, Hoo-Choon), the ancestral and unceded land of the Chochenyo (Cho-chen-yo) speaking Ohlone people, the successors of the historic and sovereign Verona Band of Alameda County. This land was and continues to be of great importance to the Muwekma (Muh-wek-muh) Ohlone Tribe and other familial descendants of the Verona Band. We recognize that every member of the Berkeley community has benefitted, and continues to benefit from the use and occupation of this land since the institution’s founding in 1868. Consistent with our values of community and diversity, we have a responsibility to acknowledge and make visible the university’s relationship to Native peoples. By offering this Land Acknowledgement, we affirm Indigenous sovereignty and will work to hold the University of California, Berkeley more accountable to the needs of American Indian and Indigenous peoples. This statement was developed in partnership with the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe and is a living document. Read more on the Centers for Educational Justice &amp; Community Engagement Website . ",
